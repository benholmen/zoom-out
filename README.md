# Zoom Out

A tiny Chrome plugin that closes your Zoom join tabs after your meeting has loaded.

## Installation
I likely won't push this to the Chrome web store (Zoomâ„¢) but you can install it manually:

1. Clone the repo locally:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:benholmen/zoom-out.git [/sensible/local/path/zoom-out]
```
2. Open Google Chrome extensions page [chrome://extensions/]
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click Load Unpacked
5. Choose the folder you selected
